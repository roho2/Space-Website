# Space-Website
Website built for my Internet Applications class. 

The basic idea for the assignment was to build a simple website using HTML and CSS about something that you are interested in. 
I chose to make it on SpaceX and their work in Boca Chica, Texas developing a new rocket. 
It is a simple design and, as of now, only the home page is done. 
If we make updates in the class for future assignments I will update the project here as well.
